#From local pc 
% ssh-keygen -b 2048 -N "" -t rsa
# save it in /tmp/dugma/id_rsa
#-N - without pwd
#output like this: #---[RSA 2048]---
#public key is id_rsa.pub, it include my user in the end (myuser@) removing it and writing for example qa@
#to do base64
cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub | base64 -w0 > /tmp/id_rsa.pub.b64
#-w is used to specify the maximum line width for encoding
#When you specify -w0, it means that there is no line wrapping, and the output will be a continuous stream of characters without any line breaks. 
This can be useful in situations where you want to encode data without inserting line breaks or spaces, which is sometimes needed 
for specific use cases like embedding data in a JSON or XML file.
#to convert from base64
cat id_rsa.pub.b64 | base64 -d > id_rsa.pub.new
