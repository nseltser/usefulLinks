1. Login to Jenkins, press on User, press on Configure, go to Api Token
2. New token, give meanfull name, generate - it will generate Token for this user with no expireday
3. Example how to trigger job:
curl -X POST http://<job_url>/buildWithParameters \ 
  --user user:token \
  --data-urlencode "param1=paramvalue" \
  --data-urlencode "SUBMIT=True"

When we want to trigger Jenkins job from Azure pipeline, we can transfer to Jenkins the user name who is running the pipeline or URL of Azure pipeline, 
but we can use hard coded token of mine.
